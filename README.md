# userscripts
This repoistory contains various userscripts I have created for various sites with the simple goal of "making life easier" in one way or another.

### myanimelist.net
MAL is a great anime/manga list site, but I've always had a few issues with how limiting some of the features are. The below scripts try to remove those limits (Mostly using off-site databases).  
Although it should be obvious, users without the said userscript will not be able to view added info.

#### mal_favourites
This adds a "exfavourites" option to MAL. These favourites are not limited to the usual 5 anime/manga/people & 10 characters that MAL is limited to.  
These show below the MAL favourites and are highlighted.

#### mal_history
This replaces MALs history with one that uses my own DB. It also logs changes to stuff such as score etc.  
This was made due to MALs history being absolute shit. It has two major problems: Newly added series aren't logged & /history/ only lasts a month.

#### mal_precise
This allows scores to be set to one decimal place (8.5 etc.).   
This has been requested multiple times on MAL and said it wouldn't be implemented. This was my answer to that.



## Misc
If you want, you can also grab my userscripts from [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/users/2392-daku).
