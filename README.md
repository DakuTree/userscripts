# **userscripts**
This repository contains various userscripts I have created for various sites with the simple goal of "making life easier".  
All of these were built to work with Chrome+Tampermonkey in mind, so they may not work if not ran under the same environment.


### **myanimelist.net**
[Most of the changes here are only visible to yourself and others with the script]
####  *Extended Favourites*
This is intended to give the user an infinite amount of favourites by using an off-site DB.  
These show below the MAL favourites and are highlighted.
#### *Infinite History*
This replaces MALs history with one that uses an off-site DB. It also logs changes to stuff such as score etc.  
This was made due to MALs history being absolute shit. It has two major problems: Newly added series aren't logged & /history/ only lasts a month.
#### *Precise Scores*
This allows scores to be set to one decimal place (8.5, 9.2 etc.) using an off-site DB.   
This has been requested multiple times on MAL and said it wouldn't be implemented. This was my answer to that.
#### *MiscTweaks*
This is intended to be a dump for small tweaks to MAL.   
Currently the only tweak added is one that defaults the search to whatever the current page is (so if you are on /manga/, it defaults to manga).

### **e-hentai.org**
##### *One-Click DL*
This is a replacement for the in-built one-click method (which isn't really one-click, as a pop-up is generated). 
##### *CompactSearch*
Replaces the navbar & search box with a new navbar which includes the search, therefore saving vertical space.

### **rememberthemilk.com**
##### *Randomize List*
Adds a small button to the TODO list page which randomizes the current list.


### **backloggery.com**
#### *NP Extra Statuses*
Adds a simple list sorting system.  
Adding [on-hold] or [to-play] to the start of a game description will filter it under a header of the same name.  
(This will only be visible to those with the userscript!)
#### *AJAX Cookie of Fortune*
This turns the fortune cookie into one that uses AJAX so it's easy/quick to get a new cookie.
